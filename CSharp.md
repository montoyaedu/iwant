Building from command-line.
===========================

You can open the solution file with visual studio or compile from the command-line:

`````
    cd MyPackage.MyApp
    msbuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug MyPackage.MyApp_vs2010.sln
`````

On unix systems Xamarin can be used. Just replace msbuild with xbuild.
